TurboTrainer
============

TurboTrainer is a really simple application that loads in a GPX file and plays it back in real time, displaying the routeâ€™s current gradient on the screen.

The idea is to be able to use it with an exercise bike or turbo trainer to make your workouts a bit more realistic by following an actual outdoor route. You'd just watch the display and adjust the trainer's resistance according the displayed gradient.

I made it as an exercise in using [Xamarin](http://xamarin.com/) and [ReactiveUI](http://www.reactiveui.net/) to write cross-platform MVVM. The project contains a WPF app and an Android app sharing practically all of the same code. There's a [blog post](http://ianreah.com/2013/11/24/cross-platform-mvvm-with-reactiveui-and-xamarin.html) if you want to read more about this.
